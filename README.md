# One consistent API :
###### .NET provides a standard set of base class libraries and APIs that are common to all .NET applications.

###### Each app model can also expose additional APIs that are specific to the operating systems it runs on, or the capabilities it provides. For example, ASP.NET is the cross-platform web framework that provides additional APIs for building web apps that run on Linux or Windows.
